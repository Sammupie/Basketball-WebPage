        <p>Basketball is a sport I play a lot because it is very engaging and enjoyable. It not only gives you great physical exercise but also challenges your mind to think and play creativelyso that you can score. There are multiple dimensions to Basketball and it can be a very complex sport, but I find it to be very fun and exciting. The feeling you get when the ball goes through the net and you score when your team needed you too is priceless.</p>

        <h2>My favorite team-Golden State Warriors</h2>
        <h3>This is my inspiration</h3>
        <div><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6589/draymond-green" target="_blank"><img src=https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=http://hoopshabit.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2016/04/1191990192.jpeg&c=sc&w=3200&h=2185> </a>
        <h2>Draymond Green</h2>
        <p>He is defintely my favorite because of the level of intelligence he brings to the game, to help the warriors. He might not score much, but he can get great assists and can restrict the opposing team's best player from scoring thanks to his suffocating defence. All in all, every team wants to have a Draymond and since the warriors have him, they are doing good. This is why he is my inspiration, he does not have any athletic gifts but still excels at the game of basketball.</p></div>
